Fireworks-based workflow management for using and benchmarking ML/CIDER XC functionals.

NOTE: These tools are not currently intended for general use and are not documented
or curated as a Python package. They are available just for the sake of making
as much CIDER-related code publicly available as possible. See
[CiderPress](https://github.com/mir-group/CiderPress)
for the (pre-release) code used to run CIDER calculations.
